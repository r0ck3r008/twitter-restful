# Twitter for Highly Concurrent Systems: Webapp Part

In this project we have created a web interface to demonstrate the Twitter functionalities that we have built in the first part of the project.

#### Functionalities
* Account registration - Sign up functionality for new users
* Login - Authenticates a user trying to access the application.
* Send Tweets - An existing user can send tweets. Tweets can have hashtags
* Subscribe - A user can follow/subscribe another user to receive his/her tweets.
* Re-tweets - User can Re-tweet so that subscribers get an interesting tweet which the user came across and wants to share.
* Querying tweets - This allows querying tweets subscribed to, tweets with specific hashtags and tweets in which the user is mentioned.
* Live delivery of tweets - If the user connected to the application, all the above types of tweets are delivered live without the user having to query for the tweets.

#### Dependencies
* Elixir
* Earlang
* Phoenix Framework
* NodeJS
